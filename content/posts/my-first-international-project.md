## Story
As an Iranian, I can't work with other countries every day. Some won't accept my nationality! 
Even if they accept it, there are many problems when it comes to payment!
you might wonder well it's not a hard thing but believe me when I say it.
It's too damn HARD! But anyway, let me tell the story.

One day an Indian guy found my profile in [Rive](https://rive.app/a/SamadiPour/).
He wanted an animation for his flutter application. So we talked about it and I prepared everything. 
The job was easy, and he liked it very much. after two or three weeks, he came to me with a new project.

## Project Details
Basally it was a simple task management application that admin could create tasks for employees.
The app is connected to API and Firebase services. Some of the app's necessary features:

- Sending and Receiving task attachment
- Comment about the task from employee
- Task timeline for every day
- User report statistics
- Push notification (with Firebase Cloud Messaging)

I started the project on Jun 24 and finished it on Jun 30. although the project had 7-10 days time, I needed to focus on
university exams, and I needed to finish it fast. So I spent a lot more than usual working on it. I also have
a time tracker in Android Studio which tells me that I spent 47 hours coding for this project.

## Demo
I hope you enjoy it.
